Execute the command gcloud compute list B. Execute the command gcloud compute instances list C. Execute the command gcloud instances list D. Execute the command gcloud list instances
117~ When creating a VM using the command line, how should you specify labels for the VM? A. Use the --labels option with labels in the format of KEYS:VALUES. B. Use the --labels option with labels in the format of KEYS=VALUE. C. Use the --labels option with labels in the format of KEYS,VALUES. D. This is not possible in the command line
118~ In the boot disk advanced configuration, which operations can you specify when creating a new VM? A. Add a new disk, reformat an existing disk, attach an existing disk B. Add a new disk and reformat an existing disk C. Add a new disk and attach an existing disk D. Reformat an existing disk and attach an existing disk
119~ You have acquired a 10 GB data set from a third-party research firm. A group of data scientists would like to access this data from their statistics programs written in R. R works well with Linux and Windows file systems, and the data scientists are familiar with file operations in R. The data scientists would each like to have their own dedicated VM with the data available in the VM’s file system. What is a way to make this data readily available on a VM and minimize the steps the data scientists will have to take? A. Store the data in Cloud Storage. B. Create VMs using a source image created from a disk with the data on it. C. Store the data in Google Drive. D. Load the data into BigQuery.
120~ The Network tab of the create VM form is where you would perform which of the following operations? A. Set the IP address of the VM B. Add a network interface to the VM C. Specify a default router D. Change firewall configuration rules
121~ You want to create a VM using the gcloud command. What parameter would you include to specify the type of boot disk? A. boot-disk-type B. boot-disk C. disk-type D. type-boot-disk
122~ Which of the following commands will create a VM with four CPUs that is named webserver-1? A. gcloud compute instances create --machine-type=n1-standard-4 web-server-1 B. gcloud compute instances create --cpus=4 web-server-1 C. gcloud compute instances create --machine-type=n1-standard-4 –instancename web-server-1 D. gcloud compute instances create --machine-type=n1-4-cpu web-server-1
123~ Which of the following commands will stop a VM named web-server-1? A. gcloud compute instances halt web-server-1 B. gcloud compute instances --terminate web-server1 C. gcloud compute instances stop web-server-1 D. gcloud compute stop web-server-1
124~ You have just created an Ubuntu VM and want to log into the VM to install some software packages. Which network service would you use to access the VM? A. FTP B. SSH C. RDP D. ipconfig
125~ Your management team is considering three different cloud providers. You have been asked to summarize billing and cost information to help the management team compare cost structures between clouds. Which of the following would you mention about the cost of VMs in GCP? A. VMs are billed in 1-second increments, cost varies with the number of CPUs and amount of memory in a machine type, you can create custom machine types, preemptible VMs cost up to 80 percent less than standard VMs, and Google offers discounts for sustained usage. B. VMs are billed in 1-second increments and VMs can run up to 24 hours before they will be be shut down. C. Google offers discounts for sustained usage in only some regions, cost varies with the number of CPUs and amount of memory in a machine type, you can create custom machine types, preemptible VMs cost up to 80 percent less than standard VMs. D. VMs are charged for a minimum of 1 hour of use and cost varies with the number of CPUs and amount of memory in a machine type.
