A company can accurately predict server need for an extended period of time C. A company has a fixed IT budget D. A company has a variable IT budge
9~Your company is based in X and will be running a virtual server for Y. What factor determines the unit per minute cost? A. The time of day the VM is run B. The characteristics of the server C. The application you run D. None of the above

11~You have to run a number of services to support an application. Which of the following is a good deployment model? A. Run on a large, single VM B. Use containers in a managed cluster C. Use two large VMs, making one of them read only D. Use a small VM for all services and increase the size of the VM when CPU utilization exceeds 90 percent
12~You have created a VM. Which of the following system administration operations are you allowed to perform on it? A. Configure the file system B. Patch operating system software C. Change file and directory permissions D. All of the abov
13~Cloud Filestore is based on what file system technology? A. Network File System (NFS) B. XFS C. EXT4 D. ReiserFS

A cache will continue to store data even if power is lost, improving availability. C. Caches can get out of sync with the system of truth. D. Using a cache will reduce latency, since retrieving from a cache is faster than retrieving from SSDs or HDDs.
16~Why can cloud providers offer elastic resource allocation? A. Cloud providers can take resources from lower-priority customers and give them to higher-priority customers. B. Extensive resources and the ability to quickly shift resources between customers enables public cloud providers to offer elastic resource allocation more efficiently than can be done in smaller data centers. C. They charge more the more resources you use. D. They don’t.
