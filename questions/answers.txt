1~ B~ The basic unit for purchasing computing resources is the virtual machine (VM). A physical server underlies VMs, but the resources of a physical server are allocated to VMs. Blocks and subnets are not relevant to the fundamental unit of computing.
2~ D~ When using managed clusters, the cloud provider will monitor the health of nodes in the cluster, set up networking between nodes in the cluster, and configure firewall and other security controls.
3~ B~ App Engine is a serverless platform for running applications, while Cloud Functions is a service for executing short-running functions in response to events. Kubernetes Engine is a managed cluster service, and both Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine require you to configure servers.
4~ B~ Object storage, like Cloud Storage, provides redundantly stored objects without limits on the amount of data you can store, which makes option B correct. Since file system functionality is not required, option D is not a good option. Block storage could be used, but you would have to manage your own replication to ensure high availability. Caches are transient, in-memory storage and are not high-availability, persistent storage systems.
5~ D~ Block sizes in a block storage system can vary; therefore, option D is the correct answer. Block size is established when a file system is created. 4KB block sizes are commonly used in Linux.
6~ C~ Firewalls in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are software-defined network controls that limit the flow of traffic into and out of a network or subnetwork, so option C is the correct answer. Routers are used to move traffic to appropriate destinations on the network. Identity access management is used for authenticating and authorizing users; it is not relevant to network controls between subnetworks. IP address tables are not a security control.
7~ C~ Option C is correct because specialized services in GCP are serverless. Google manages the compute resources used by the services. There is no need for a user to allocate or  monitor VMs.
8~ B~ Option B is correct; investing in servers works well when an organization can accurately predict the number of servers and other equipment it will need for an extended period and can utilize that equipment consistently. Startups are not established businesses with histories that can guide expected needs in three to five years. It does not matter if a budget is fixed or variable; investing in servers should be based on demand for server capacity.
9~ B~ The characteristics of the server, such as the number of virtual servers, the amount of memory, and the region where you run the VM, influence the cost, so option B is correct. Time of day is not a factor, nor is the type of application you run on the VM.
10~ D~ Cloud Vision is one of GCP’s specialized services. Users of the service do not need to configure any VMs to use the service.
11~ B~ Containers give the most flexibility for using the resources of a cluster efficiently and orchestration platforms reduce the operations overhead, which makes option B correct. Running in a single cluster is not recommended because if the server fails, all services will be down. Using two VMs with one read-only is not useful. Read-only servers are sometimes used with databases, but there was no mention of databases in the question. Using a small VM and upgrading when it is no longer able to keep up with the workload delivers poorquality service to users and should be avoided.
12~ D~ All of the operations are available to a system administrator after creating a VM,  so option D is correct.
13~ A~ Option A is correct; Cloud Filestore is based on Network Filesystem (NSF), which is a distributed file management system. The other options are file systems supported by Linux but are not the foundation of Cloud Filestore.
14~ A~ When you create a network, it is treated as a virtual private cloud, which makes option A correct. Resources are added to the VPC and are not accessible outside the VPC unless you explicitly configure them to be. A subdomain is related to web domains and not related to GPC network configuration. Clusters, such as Kubernetes clusters, may be in your network, but are not a characteristic of the network.
15~ D~ Caches use memory, and that makes them the fastest storage type for reading data, so option D is right. Caches are data stores on the backend of distributed systems, not the clients. A cache would have no effect on client-side JavaScript execution. Caches do not store data in a cache if power is lost; the data would have to be reloaded. Caches can get out of sync with the system of truth because the system of truth could be updated, but the cache may not be updated. Caches have faster read times than SSDs and HDDs.
16~ B~ Option B is correct; cloud providers have large capacity and can quickly allocate those resources to different customers. With a mix of customers and workloads, they can optimize the allocation of resources. Option A is incorrect; cloud providers do not take resources from one customer to give them to another, with the exception of preemptible instances. Option C is incorrect; cloud providers usually offer discounts for increased use.
17~ C~ Specialized services are monitored by Google so users do not have to monitor them; therefore, option C is correct. Specialized services provide a specific compute functionality but do not require the user to configure any resources. They also provide APIs.
18~ B~ Attached drives are block storage devices. Cloud Storage is the object storage service and does not attach directly to a VM. NoSQL is a type of database, not a storage system. Attached drives may be either SSDs or hard drives.
19~ C~ Databases require persistent storage on block devices. Object storage does not provide data block or file system storage, making option C the correct answer. Data storage is not a type of storage system. Caches are often used with databases to improve read performance, but they are volatile and are not suitable for persistently storing data files.
20~ B~ All three services are serverless, so the user does not need to configure VMs; therefore, option B is correct. Cloud Storage is charged based on time and size of data stored. App Engine Standard and Cloud Functions are not restricted to just the Go language.
21~ A~ Machine type, boot disk image or container image, zone, and labels are all configuration parameters or attributes of a VM and therefore would be included in an instance group configuration that creates those VMs.
22~ B~ gsutil is the command line for accessing and manipulating Cloud Storage from the command line. mb is the specific command for creating, or making, a bucket.
23~ D~ The lifecycle configuration policy allows administrators to specify criteria for migrating data to other storage systems without having to concern themselves with running jobs to actually execute the necessary steps. The other options are inefficient or do not exist.
24~ A~ gsutil is the command-line tool for working with Cloud Storage. rsync is the specific command in gsutil for synchronizing buckets.
25~ C~ Google operates a global network, and VPCs are resources that can span that global network.
26~ B~ gcloud by default will retry a failed network operation and will wait a long time  before each retry. The time to wait is calculated using a truncated binary exponential  back-off strategy.
27~ C~ Firewall rules do not have TTL parameters. Direction of traffic, action on match, and protocol are all components of firewall rules.
28~ C~ IAM policy violations do not trigger changes in the size of clusters. All other options can be used to trigger a change in cluster size.
29~ A~ Only Spanner and Cloud SQL databases support transactions and have a SQL interface. Datastore has transactions but does not support fully compliant SQL; it has a SQL-like query language. Cloud Storage does not support transactions or SQL.
30~ C~ App Engine is a PaaS that allows developers to deploy full applications without having to manage servers or clusters. Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine require management of servers. Cloud Functions is suitable for short-running Node.js or Python functions but not full applications.
31~ B~ BigQuery is designed for petabyte-scale analytics and provides a SQL interface.
32~ B~ Cloud Dataflow allows for stream and batch processing of data and is well suited for this kind of ETL work. Dataproc is a managed Hadoop and Spark service that is used for big data analytics. Cloud Endpoints is an API service, and Cloud Interconnect is a network service.
33~ C~ If a preemptible machine has not been shut down within 24 hours, Google will stop  the instance.
34~ A~ Organizations, folders, and projects are the components used to manage an organizational hierarchy. Buckets, directories, and subdirectories are used to organize storage.
35~ B~ gcloud is the command-line tool for working with IAM, and list-grantable-roles is the correct command.
36~ A~ gcloud is the command-line tool for manipulating compute resources, and zones describe is the correct command.
37~ C~ iam.roles.create is correct; the other roles do not exist.
38~ B~ The /22 suffix produces 1,022 usable IP addresses.
39~ A~ Cloud Dataproc is the managed Spark service. Cloud Dataflow is for stream and batch processing of data, BigQuery is for analytics, and Cloud Hadoop is not a GCP service.
40~ D~ Cloud Functions responds to events in Cloud Storage, making them a good choice for taking an action after a file is loaded.
41~ B~ Google Cloud Interconnect – Dedicated is the only option for a dedicated connection between a customer’s data center and a Google data center.
42~ A~ Enabling the Google Cloud KMS API and setting up billing are steps common to using GCP services.
43~ D~ A node pool is a subset of node instances within a cluster that all have the same configuration.
44~ C~ The GCP service for storing and managing Docker containers is Container Registry. Cloud Build is for creating images. The others are not GCP services.
45~ A~ Node.js 6, Node.js 8, and Python are the languages supported by Cloud Functions.
46~ C~ Cloud Load Balancing distributes workloads within and across regions, provides health checks, and implements autoscaling. Cloud DNS provides domain name services, such as translating a URL like www.example.com to an IP address. Cloud Spanner is a distributed relational database but does not implement workload distribution. Cloud CDN distributes content across regions to reduce latency when delivering content to users across the globe.
47~ C~ App Engine flexible environments allow you to run containers on the App Engine PaaS. Kubernetes Engine is an orchestration platform for running containers. Both provide container management services. The App Engine standard environment runs applications in language-specific sandboxes and is not a general container management system. Cloud Functions is a serverless service for running code in response to events. It does not provide container services.
48~ D~ Options A and B are both correct answers. The Apigee API platform provides policybased rate-limiting and routing services to help accommodate spikes in traffic. It also provides OAuth 2.0 and SAML authentication. It does not provide version control; Cloud Source Repositories is the service user for version control.
49~ A~ Cloud Armor builds on GCP’s load balancing services to provide the ability to allow or restrict access based on IP address, deploy rules to counter cross-site scripting attacks, and provide countermeasures to SQL injection attacks. Cloud CDN is a content distribution service, not a security service. Identity Access Management is a security service, but it is for authentication and authorization, not denial-of-service mitigation. Virtual private clouds are used to restrict network access to an organization’s resources, but it does not have features to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. Also, Cloud CDN acts as a first line of defense in the case of DDoS attacks.
50~ A~ This is a good use case for preemptible VMs because they could reduce the cost of running the second application without the risk of losing work. Since tasks are deleted from the queue only after they are completed if a preemptible VM is shut down before completing the task, another VM can perform the task. Also, there is no harm in running a task more than once, so if two VMs do the same task, it will not adversely affect the output of the application. DataProc and Spanner are not appropriate products for this task.
51~ B~ Cloud Memorystore is the only GCP designed to cache data in memory. Cloud SQL is a relational database service and might be a good option for the backend database. Cloud Spanner is a global relational database and is a good option when you need a globally consistent database. Cloud Datastore is a document database suitable for product catalogs, user profiles, and other semistructured data.
52~ D~ All three of the services listed, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and network firewalls, can be managed and configured using Cloud SDK.
53~ D~ Cloud Functions is a serverless product, no configuration is required.
54~ D~ The Stackdriver Logging product is used to consolidate and manage logs generated by applications and servers.
55~ B~ The data analytics set of specialized services includes products that help with extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) and work with both batch and streaming data. The Apigee API platform is used for managing APIs and does not meet the needs described. AI and machine learning might be useful for analyzing data in the data warehouse, but the services in that set are not always helpful for ETL operations. Cloud SDK is used to control services but by itself is not directly able to perform the operations needed.
56~ B~ Bigtable is designed to accept billions of rows of data. Collecting data from 100,000 sensors every 5 seconds will generate 6,000,000 data points every minute, or 8,640,000,000 data points per day. Spanner is a relational database and supports transactions, but they are not needed. Cloud SQL MySQL and Cloud SQL PostgreSQL would be difficult to scale to this level of read and write performance.
57~ A~ Cloud Firestore is a mobile database service that can synchronize data between mobile devices and centralized storage. Spanner is a global relational database for large-scale applications that require transaction support in highly scaled databases. Datastore and Cloud SQL could be used but would require more custom development to synchronize data between mobile devices and the centralized data store.
58~ B~ A computationally intensive application obviously requires high CPUs, but the fact that there are many mathematical calculations indicates that a GPU should be used. You might consider running this in a cluster, but the work is not easily distributed over multiple servers, so you will need to have a single server capable of handling the load. Immediate access to large amounts of data indicates that a high-memory machine should be recommended.
59~ B~ Identities are abstractions of users. They can also represent characteristics of processes that run on behalf of a human user or a VM in the GCP. Identities are not related to VM IDs. Roles are collections of privileges that can be granted to identities. Option D is
60~ C~ Cloud Natural Language Processing provides functionality for analyzing text. Cloud Text Miner does not exist. Cloud ML is a general-purpose machine learning service that could be applied to text analysis but would require knowledge of language processing, which the client does not have. Cloud Vision is for image processing.
61~ B~ Both options B and D would meet the need of running Spark, which would give the data scientists access to the machine library they need. However, option D requires that they manage and monitor the cluster of servers, which would require more DevOps and administration work than if they used the Dataproc service. Option C, BigQuery, is a scalable database, not a platform for running Spark. Cloud Spark is a fictitious product and does not exist in the GCP.
62~ B~ Option B is correct. Spanner supports ANSI 2011 standard SQL and global transactions. Cloud SQL supports standard SQL but does not have global transaction. Datastore and Bigtable are NoSQL databases.
63~ A~ Dataproc is designed to execute workflows in both batch and streaming modes, which makes option A correct. BigQuery is a data warehouse service. Datastore is a document database. AutoML is a machine learning service.
64~ C~ App Engine standard environment provides a serverless Python sandbox that scales automatically, so option C is correct. App Engine flexible environment runs containers and requires more configuration. Cloud Engine and Kubernetes Engine both require significant management and monitoring.
65~ D~ Error reporting consolidates crash information, which makes Error Reporting the right answer. Monitoring collects metrics on application and server performance. Logging is a log management service. Dataproc is not part of Stackdriver; it is a managed Hadoop and Spark service.
66~ A B C~ The environment is already set up you dont need to do anything else.
