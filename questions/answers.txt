1~ B~ The basic unit for purchasing computing resources is the virtual machine (VM). A physical server underlies VMs, but the resources of a physical server are allocated to VMs. Blocks and subnets are not relevant to the fundamental unit of computing.
2~ D~ When using managed clusters, the cloud provider will monitor the health of nodes in the cluster, set up networking between nodes in the cluster, and configure firewall and other security controls.
3~ B~ App Engine is a serverless platform for running applications, while Cloud Functions is a service for executing short-running functions in response to events. Kubernetes Engine is a managed cluster service, and both Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine require you to configure servers.
4~ B~ Object storage, like Cloud Storage, provides redundantly stored objects without limits on the amount of data you can store, which makes option B correct. Since file system functionality is not required, option D is not a good option. Block storage could be used, but you would have to manage your own replication to ensure high availability. Caches are transient, in-memory storage and are not high-availability, persistent storage systems.
5~ D~ Block sizes in a block storage system can vary; therefore, option D is the correct answer. Block size is established when a file system is created. 4KB block sizes are commonly used in Linux.
6~ C~ Firewalls in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are software-defined network controls that limit the flow of traffic into and out of a network or subnetwork, so option C is the correct answer. Routers are used to move traffic to appropriate destinations on the network. Identity access management is used for authenticating and authorizing users; it is not relevant to network controls between subnetworks. IP address tables are not a security control.
7~ C~ Option C is correct because specialized services in GCP are serverless. Google manages the compute resources used by the services. There is no need for a user to allocate or  monitor VMs.
8~ B~ Option B is correct; investing in servers works well when an organization can accurately predict the number of servers and other equipment it will need for an extended period and can utilize that equipment consistently. Startups are not established businesses with histories that can guide expected needs in three to five years. It does not matter if a budget is fixed or variable; investing in servers should be based on demand for server capacity.
9~ B~ The characteristics of the server, such as the number of virtual servers, the amount of memory, and the region where you run the VM, influence the cost, so option B is correct. Time of day is not a factor, nor is the type of application you run on the VM.
10~ D~ Cloud Vision is one of GCP’s specialized services. Users of the service do not need to configure any VMs to use the service.
11~ B~ Containers give the most flexibility for using the resources of a cluster efficiently and orchestration platforms reduce the operations overhead, which makes option B correct. Running in a single cluster is not recommended because if the server fails, all services will be down. Using two VMs with one read-only is not useful. Read-only servers are sometimes used with databases, but there was no mention of databases in the question. Using a small VM and upgrading when it is no longer able to keep up with the workload delivers poorquality service to users and should be avoided.
12~ D~ All of the operations are available to a system administrator after creating a VM,  so option D is correct.
13~ A~ Option A is correct; Cloud Filestore is based on Network Filesystem (NSF), which is a distributed file management system. The other options are file systems supported by Linux but are not the foundation of Cloud Filestore.
14~ A~ When you create a network, it is treated as a virtual private cloud, which makes option A correct. Resources are added to the VPC and are not accessible outside the VPC unless you explicitly configure them to be. A subdomain is related to web domains and not related to GPC network configuration. Clusters, such as Kubernetes clusters, may be in your network, but are not a characteristic of the network.
15~ D~ Caches use memory, and that makes them the fastest storage type for reading data, so option D is right. Caches are data stores on the backend of distributed systems, not the clients. A cache would have no effect on client-side JavaScript execution. Caches do not store data in a cache if power is lost; the data would have to be reloaded. Caches can get out of sync with the system of truth because the system of truth could be updated, but the cache may not be updated. Caches have faster read times than SSDs and HDDs.
16~ B~ Option B is correct; cloud providers have large capacity and can quickly allocate those resources to different customers. With a mix of customers and workloads, they can optimize the allocation of resources. Option A is incorrect; cloud providers do not take resources from one customer to give them to another, with the exception of preemptible instances. Option C is incorrect; cloud providers usually offer discounts for increased use.
17~ C~ Specialized services are monitored by Google so users do not have to monitor them; therefore, option C is correct. Specialized services provide a specific compute functionality but do not require the user to configure any resources. They also provide APIs.
18~ B~ Attached drives are block storage devices. Cloud Storage is the object storage service and does not attach directly to a VM. NoSQL is a type of database, not a storage system. Attached drives may be either SSDs or hard drives.
19~ C~ Databases require persistent storage on block devices. Object storage does not provide data block or file system storage, making option C the correct answer. Data storage is not a type of storage system. Caches are often used with databases to improve read performance, but they are volatile and are not suitable for persistently storing data files.
20~ B~ All three services are serverless, so the user does not need to configure VMs; therefore, option B is correct. Cloud Storage is charged based on time and size of data stored. App Engine Standard and Cloud Functions are not restricted to just the Go language.
21~ A~ Machine type, boot disk image or container image, zone, and labels are all configuration parameters or attributes of a VM and therefore would be included in an instance group configuration that creates those VMs.
22~ B~ gsutil is the command line for accessing and manipulating Cloud Storage from the command line. mb is the specific command for creating, or making, a bucket.
23~ D~ The lifecycle configuration policy allows administrators to specify criteria for migrating data to other storage systems without having to concern themselves with running jobs to actually execute the necessary steps. The other options are inefficient or do not exist.
24~ A~ gsutil is the command-line tool for working with Cloud Storage. rsync is the specific command in gsutil for synchronizing buckets.
25~ C~ Google operates a global network, and VPCs are resources that can span that global network.
26~ B~ gcloud by default will retry a failed network operation and will wait a long time  before each retry. The time to wait is calculated using a truncated binary exponential  back-off strategy.
27~ C~ Firewall rules do not have TTL parameters. Direction of traffic, action on match, and protocol are all components of firewall rules.
28~ C~ IAM policy violations do not trigger changes in the size of clusters. All other options can be used to trigger a change in cluster size.
29~ A~ Only Spanner and Cloud SQL databases support transactions and have a SQL interface. Datastore has transactions but does not support fully compliant SQL; it has a SQL-like query language. Cloud Storage does not support transactions or SQL.
30~ C~ App Engine is a PaaS that allows developers to deploy full applications without having to manage servers or clusters. Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine require management of servers. Cloud Functions is suitable for short-running Node.js or Python functions but not full applications.
31~ B~ BigQuery is designed for petabyte-scale analytics and provides a SQL interface.
32~ B~ Cloud Dataflow allows for stream and batch processing of data and is well suited for this kind of ETL work. Dataproc is a managed Hadoop and Spark service that is used for big data analytics. Cloud Endpoints is an API service, and Cloud Interconnect is a network service.
33~ C~ If a preemptible machine has not been shut down within 24 hours, Google will stop  the instance.
34~ A~ Organizations, folders, and projects are the components used to manage an organizational hierarchy. Buckets, directories, and subdirectories are used to organize storage.
35~ B~ gcloud is the command-line tool for working with IAM, and list-grantable-roles is the correct command.
36~ A~ gcloud is the command-line tool for manipulating compute resources, and zones describe is the correct command.
37~ C~ iam.roles.create is correct; the other roles do not exist.
38~ B~ The /22 suffix produces 1,022 usable IP addresses.
39~ A~ Cloud Dataproc is the managed Spark service. Cloud Dataflow is for stream and batch processing of data, BigQuery is for analytics, and Cloud Hadoop is not a GCP service.
40~ D~ Cloud Functions responds to events in Cloud Storage, making them a good choice for taking an action after a file is loaded.
41~ B~ Google Cloud Interconnect – Dedicated is the only option for a dedicated connection between a customer’s data center and a Google data center.
42~ A~ Enabling the Google Cloud KMS API and setting up billing are steps common to using GCP services.
43~ D~ A node pool is a subset of node instances within a cluster that all have the same configuration.
44~ C~ The GCP service for storing and managing Docker containers is Container Registry. Cloud Build is for creating images. The others are not GCP services.
45~ A~ Node.js 6, Node.js 8, and Python are the languages supported by Cloud Functions.
46~ C~ Cloud Load Balancing distributes workloads within and across regions, provides health checks, and implements autoscaling. Cloud DNS provides domain name services, such as translating a URL like www.example.com to an IP address. Cloud Spanner is a distributed relational database but does not implement workload distribution. Cloud CDN distributes content across regions to reduce latency when delivering content to users across the globe.
47~ C~ App Engine flexible environments allow you to run containers on the App Engine PaaS. Kubernetes Engine is an orchestration platform for running containers. Both provide container management services. The App Engine standard environment runs applications in language-specific sandboxes and is not a general container management system. Cloud Functions is a serverless service for running code in response to events. It does not provide container services.
48~ D~ Options A and B are both correct answers. The Apigee API platform provides policybased rate-limiting and routing services to help accommodate spikes in traffic. It also provides OAuth 2.0 and SAML authentication. It does not provide version control; Cloud Source Repositories is the service user for version control.
49~ A~ Cloud Armor builds on GCP’s load balancing services to provide the ability to allow or restrict access based on IP address, deploy rules to counter cross-site scripting attacks, and provide countermeasures to SQL injection attacks. Cloud CDN is a content distribution service, not a security service. Identity Access Management is a security service, but it is for authentication and authorization, not denial-of-service mitigation. Virtual private clouds are used to restrict network access to an organization’s resources, but it does not have features to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. Also, Cloud CDN acts as a first line of defense in the case of DDoS attacks.
50~ A~ This is a good use case for preemptible VMs because they could reduce the cost of running the second application without the risk of losing work. Since tasks are deleted from the queue only after they are completed if a preemptible VM is shut down before completing the task, another VM can perform the task. Also, there is no harm in running a task more than once, so if two VMs do the same task, it will not adversely affect the output of the application. DataProc and Spanner are not appropriate products for this task.
51~ B~ Cloud Memorystore is the only GCP designed to cache data in memory. Cloud SQL is a relational database service and might be a good option for the backend database. Cloud Spanner is a global relational database and is a good option when you need a globally consistent database. Cloud Datastore is a document database suitable for product catalogs, user profiles, and other semistructured data.
52~ D~ All three of the services listed, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and network firewalls, can be managed and configured using Cloud SDK.
53~ D~ Cloud Functions is a serverless product, no configuration is required.
54~ D~ The Stackdriver Logging product is used to consolidate and manage logs generated by applications and servers.
55~ B~ The data analytics set of specialized services includes products that help with extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) and work with both batch and streaming data. The Apigee API platform is used for managing APIs and does not meet the needs described. AI and machine learning might be useful for analyzing data in the data warehouse, but the services in that set are not always helpful for ETL operations. Cloud SDK is used to control services but by itself is not directly able to perform the operations needed.
56~ B~ Bigtable is designed to accept billions of rows of data. Collecting data from 100,000 sensors every 5 seconds will generate 6,000,000 data points every minute, or 8,640,000,000 data points per day. Spanner is a relational database and supports transactions, but they are not needed. Cloud SQL MySQL and Cloud SQL PostgreSQL would be difficult to scale to this level of read and write performance.
57~ A~ Cloud Firestore is a mobile database service that can synchronize data between mobile devices and centralized storage. Spanner is a global relational database for large-scale applications that require transaction support in highly scaled databases. Datastore and Cloud SQL could be used but would require more custom development to synchronize data between mobile devices and the centralized data store.
58~ B~ A computationally intensive application obviously requires high CPUs, but the fact that there are many mathematical calculations indicates that a GPU should be used. You might consider running this in a cluster, but the work is not easily distributed over multiple servers, so you will need to have a single server capable of handling the load. Immediate access to large amounts of data indicates that a high-memory machine should be recommended.
59~ B~ Identities are abstractions of users. They can also represent characteristics of processes that run on behalf of a human user or a VM in the GCP. Identities are not related to VM IDs. Roles are collections of privileges that can be granted to identities. Option D is
60~ C~ Cloud Natural Language Processing provides functionality for analyzing text. Cloud Text Miner does not exist. Cloud ML is a general-purpose machine learning service that could be applied to text analysis but would require knowledge of language processing, which the client does not have. Cloud Vision is for image processing.
61~ B~ Both options B and D would meet the need of running Spark, which would give the data scientists access to the machine library they need. However, option D requires that they manage and monitor the cluster of servers, which would require more DevOps and administration work than if they used the Dataproc service. Option C, BigQuery, is a scalable database, not a platform for running Spark. Cloud Spark is a fictitious product and does not exist in the GCP.
62~ B~ Option B is correct. Spanner supports ANSI 2011 standard SQL and global transactions. Cloud SQL supports standard SQL but does not have global transaction. Datastore and Bigtable are NoSQL databases.
63~ A~ Dataproc is designed to execute workflows in both batch and streaming modes, which makes option A correct. BigQuery is a data warehouse service. Datastore is a document database. AutoML is a machine learning service.
64~ C~ App Engine standard environment provides a serverless Python sandbox that scales automatically, so option C is correct. App Engine flexible environment runs containers and requires more configuration. Cloud Engine and Kubernetes Engine both require significant management and monitoring.
65~ D~ Error reporting consolidates crash information, which makes Error Reporting the right answer. Monitoring collects metrics on application and server performance. Logging is a log management service. Dataproc is not part of Stackdriver; it is a managed Hadoop and Spark service.

66~ A~ Option A, the correct answer, separates the two main applications into their own folders and further allows separating private insurance from government payer, but using folders for each. This satisfies the regulatory need to keep the government payer software isolated from other software. Option B does not include an organization, which is the root of the resource hierarchy. Option C is not flexible with regard to differences in constraints on different applications. Option D is false because option A does meet the requirements.
67~ C~ Resource hierarchies have a single organization at the root, which makes option C correct. Below that, there are folders that can contain other folders or projects. Folders can contain multiple folders and multiple projects.
68~ B~ Service accounts are designed to give applications or VMs permission to perform tasks. Billing accounts are for associating charges with a payment method. Folders are part of resource hierarchies and have nothing to do with enabling an application to perform a task. Messaging accounts are a fictitious option.
69~ B~ Inherited policies can be overridden by defining a policy at a folder or project level. Service accounts and billing accounts are not part of the resource hierarchy and are not involved in overriding policies.
70~ E~ All of the listed types of constraints are supported in policies.
71~ B~ Option B is the correct answer because Publisher is not a primitive role. Owner, Editor, and Viewer are the three primitive privileges in GCP.
72~ D~ Primitive roles only include the Owner, Editor, and View permissions. Predefined roles are designed for GCP products and services, like App Engine and BigQuery. For a custom application, you can create sets of privileges that give the user with that role as much permission as needed but not more.
73~ D~ Users should have only the privileges that are needed to carry out their duties. This is the principle of least privilege. Rotation of duties is another security principle related to having different people perform a task at a different times. Defense in depth is the practice of using multiple security controls to protect the same asset. Option B is not a real security principal.
74~ A~ A resource hierarchy has only one organization, which makes option A correct. You can, however, create multiple folders and projects within a resource hierarchy.
75~ B~ In option B, the correct answer, the billing account is used to specify payment information and should be used to set up automatic payments. Service accounts are used to grant privileges to a VM and are not related to billing and payments. Resource accounts and credit accounts do not exist.
76~ C~ GCP offers a free service level for many products, which makes option C the correct answer. You can use these services without having to set up a billing account. Google charges for serverless products, such as Cloud Functions and App Engine, when customers exceed the amount allowed under the free tier.
77~ D~ Stackdriver Workspaces are linked to projects, not individual resources like VM instances, clusters, or App Engine apps, so option D is correct. Options A, B, and C all incorrectly indicate that Workspaces are associated with individual compute resources.
78~ D~ Large enterprises should use invoicing when incurring large charges, which makes option D the right answer. A self-service account is appropriate only for amounts that are within the credit limits of credit cards. Since the subdivisions are independently managed and have their own budgets, each should have its own billing accounts.
79~ A~ When a user is granted iam.serviceAccountUser at the project level, that user can manage all service accounts in the project, so option A is correct. If a new service account is created, they will automatically have privilege to manage that service account. You could grant iam.serviceAccountUser to the administrator at the service account level, but that would require setting the role for all service accounts. If a new service account is created, the application administrator would have to grant iam.serviceAccountUser to the other administrator on the new service account. iam.serviceProjectAccountUser is a fictional role.
80~ C~ When a service account is created, Google generates encrypted keys for authentication, making option C correct. Usernames and passwords are not an option for service accounts. Two-factor authentication is an authentication practice that requires two forms of authentication, such as a username password pair and a code from an authentication device. Biometrics cannot be used by services and is not an option.
81~ B~ Service accounts are resources that are managed by administrators, but they also function as identities that can be assigned roles, which makes option B the correct answer. Billing accounts are not related to identities. Projects are not identities; they cannot take on roles. Roles are resources but not identities. They can take on privileges, but those privileges are used only when they are attached to an identity.
82~ B~ Predefined roles are defined for a particular product, such as App Services or Compute Engine, so option B is the right answer. They bundle privileges often needed together when managing or using a service. Primitive roles are building blocks for other roles. Custom roles are created by users to meet their particular needs; Application roles is a fictitious role.
83~ B~ By default all users in an organization can create projects, which makes option B correct. The role resourcemanager.projects.create is the role that allows users to create projects. The billing account is not associated with creating projects.
84~ D~ The maximum number of organizations is determined on a per-account basis by Google, so option D is the correct answer. If you need additional organizations, you can contact Google and ask for an increase in your limit.
85~ B~ Users with the Organization IAM role are not necessarily responsible for determining what privileges should be assigned to users. That is determined based on the person’s role in the organization and the security policies established within the organization, which makes option B correct.
86~ B~ The App Engine standard environment can run Python applications, which can autoscale down to no instances when there is no load and thereby minimize costs. Compute Engine and the App Engine flexible environment both require more configuration management than the App Engine standard environment. Kubernetes Engine is used when a cluster of servers is needed to support large or multiple applications using the same computing resources.
87~ A~ Database servers require high availability to respond to queries from users or applications. Preemptible machines are guaranteed to shut down in at most 24 hours. A batch processing job with no fixed time requirements could use preemptible machines as long as the VM is restarted. High-performance computing clusters can use preemptible machines because work on a preemptible machine can be automatically rescheduled for another node on the cluster when a server is preempted. D is incorrect because there is a correct answer in the set of options.
88~ A~ VMs are created in projects, which are part of the resource hierarchy. They are also located in geographic regions and data centers, so a zone is specified as well. Usernames and admin roles are not specified during creation. The billing account is tied to a project and so does not have to be specified when the VM is created. Cloud storage buckets are created independently of VMs. Not all VMs will make use of storage buckets.
89~ C~ Compute Engine can run Docker containers if you install Docker on the VM. Kubernetes and the App Engine flexible environment support Docker containers. The App Engine standard environment provides language-specific runtime environments and does not allow customers to specify custom Docker images for use.
90~ B~ The name of the file that is used to build and configure a Docker container is Dockerfile.
91~ D~ Kubernetes uses 25 percent of memory up to 4GB and then slightly less for the next 4GB, and it continues to reduce the percentage of additional memory down to 2 percent of memory over 128GB.
92~ B~ Kubernetes provides load balancing, scaling, and automatic upgrading of software. It does not provide vulnerability scanning. GCP does have a Cloud Security Scanner product, but that is designed to work with App Engine to identify common application vulnerabilities.
93~ D~ The scenario described is a good fit for Kubernetes. Each of the groups of services can be structured in pods and deployed using Kubernetes deployment. Kubernetes Engine manages node health, load balancing, and scaling. App Engine Standard Edition has language-specific sandboxes and is not a good fit for this use case. Cloud Functions is designed for short-running event processing and is not the kind of continuous processing needed in this scenario. Compute Engine could meet the requirements of this use case, but it would require more effort on the part of application administrators and DevOps professionals to configure load balancers, monitor health, and manage software deployments.
94~ B~ This is an ideal use case for Cloud Functions. The cloud function is triggered by a file upload event. The cloud function calls the image processing service. With this setup, the two services are independent. No additional servers are required. Option A violates the requirement to keep the services independent. Options C and D incur more management overhead and will probably cost more to operate than option B.
95~ D~ Each invocation of a cloud function runs in a secure, isolated runtime environment. There is no need to check whether other invocations are running. With the Cloud Functions service, there is no way for a developer to control code execution at the process or thread level.
96~ A~ You would create a custom image after you installed the custom code, in this case the encryption library. A public image does not contain custom code, but it could be used as the base that you add custom code to. Both CentOS and Ubuntu are Linux distributions. You could use either as the base image that you add custom code to, but on their own, they do not have custom code.
97~ B~ Projects are the lowest level of the resource hierarchy. The organization is at the top of the hierarchy, and folders are between the organization and projects. VM instances are not part of the resource hierarchy.
98~ D~ All Google regions have the same level of service level agreement, so reliability is the same. Costs may differ between regions. Regulations may require that data stay within a geographic area, such as the European Union. Latency is a consideration when you want a region that is close to end users or data you will need is already stored in a particular region.
99~ B~ Compute Engine Admin Role is the role that gives users complete control over instances. Options A and C are fictitious roles. Compute Engine Security Admin gives users the privileges to create, modify, and delete SSL certificates and firewall rules.
100~ D~ Preemptible VMs will be terminated after 24 hours. Google does not guarantee that preemptible VMs will be available. Once an instance is started as a preemptible machine, it cannot migrate to a regular VM. You could, however, save a snapshot and use that to create a new regular instance.
101~ C~ Custom VMs can have up to 64 CPUs and up to 6.5GB of memory per vCPU.
102~ C~ The C programming language is not supported in the App Engine standard environment. If you need to run a C application, it can be compiled and run in a container running in the App Engine flexible environment.
103~ B~ Kubernetes reserves CPU capacity according to the following schedule: 1. 6 percent of the first core 2. 1 percent of the next core (up to two cores) 3. 0.5 percent of the next two cores (up to four cores) 4. 0.25 percent of any cores above four cores
104~ B~ The only states a Kubernetes deployment can be in are progressing, completed, and failed.
105~ A~ Cloud Functions is best suited for event-driven processing, such as a file being uploaded to Cloud Storage or an event being writing to a Pub/Sub queue. Long-running jobs, such as loading data into a data warehouse, are better suited to Compute Engine or App Engine.
106~ C~ You should verify the project selected because all operations you perform will apply to resources in the selected project, making option C the correct answer. You do not need to open Cloud Shell unless you want to work with the command line, and if you did, you should verify that the project is correctly selected first. Logging into a VM using SSH is one of the tasks that requires you to be working with the correct project, so logging in via SSH should not happen before verifying the project. The list of VMs in the VM Instance window is a list of VMs in the current project. You should verify which project you are using to ensure you are viewing the set of VMs you think you are using.
107~ A~ You will need to set up billing if it is not already enabled when you start using the console, so option A is the right answer. You may create a project, but you will be able to do this only if billing is enabled. You do not need to create a storage bucket to work with the console. Specifying a default zone is not a one-time task; you may change zones throughout the life of your project.
108~ B~ The name of the VM, the region and zone, and the machine type can all be specified in the console along with other parameters, so option B is correct. Option A is missing required parameters. A CIDR block is a range of IP addresses that is associated with asubnet and not needed to create a VM. An IP address is assigned automatically so it is not required.
109~ B~ Different zones may have different machine types available, so you will need to specify a region first and then a zone to determine the set of machine types available. If the machine type does not appear in the list, it is not available in that zone. This makes option B the correct answer. Options A and C are incorrect. Subnets and IP addresses are not related to the machine types available. Unless you are specifying a custom machine type, you do not specify the amount of memory; that is defined by the machine type, so option D is incorrect.
110~ C~ Labels and descriptions are for helping us track our own attributes of resources; GCP does not need them to perform its tasks. As the number of servers grows, it can become difficult to track which VMs are used for which applications and services, so option C is the correct answer. Labels and a general description will help administrators track numbers of VMs and their related costs. Options A and B are used for security and storage but do not help with managing multiple VMs. Option D is only partially correct. Descriptions are helpful but so are labels.
111~ A~ The Availability Policy section within the Management tab is where you set preemptibility, so option A is correct. Identity And API Access is used to control the VM’s access to Google Cloud APIs and which service account is used with the VM. Sole Tenancy is used if you need to run your VMs on physical servers that only run your VMs. Networking is used to set network tags and change the network interface.
112~ B~ Shield VM is an advanced set of security controls that includes Integrity Monitoring, a check to ensure boot images have not been tampered with, which makes option B the right answer. Firewalls are used to control ingress and egress of network traffic to a server or subnet. Project-wide SSH keys are used for authenticating users across servers within a project. Boot disk integrity check is a fictional feature.
113~ C~ Block size is not an option in the Additional Disks dialog, so option C is correct. Encryption key management, disk type, and the option of specifying a source image are all available options.
114~ B~ Using version-controlled scripts is the best approach of the four options. Scripts can be documented with reasons for the changes and they can be run repeatedly on different machines to implement the same change. This reduces the chance of error when manually entering a command. Option A does not help to improve documenting why changes were made. Option C could help improve documentation, but executable scripts are precise and accurate reflections of what was executed. Notes may miss details. Option D is not advisable. You could become a bottleneck to making changes, changes cannot be made when you are unavailable, and your memory may not be a reliable way to track all configuration changes.
115~ A~ gcloud compute instances is the start of commands for administering Compute Engine resources, making option A the right answer. Option B, gcloud instances, is missing the compute keyword that indicates we are working with Compute Engine. Option C has switched the order of compute and instances. Option D is false because option A is the correct answer.
116~ B~ Option B follows the pattern of the glcoud command, which is hierarchical and starts with the glcoud name of the service, in this case compute for Compute Engine, followed by the next level down, which in this case is instances. Finally, there is the action or verb, in this case list. Option A is missing the term instances to indicate you are working with VM instances. Option C is missing the compute keyword to indicate you are working with Compute Engine. Option D is missing the compute instance keyword and has switched the order of instances and list.
117~ B~ The correct format is to use the --labels parameter and specify the key followed by an equal sign followed by the value in option B. Options A and C have the wrong character separating the key and value. Option D is incorrect because it is possible to specify labels in the command line.
118~ C~ The two operations you can specify when using the book disk configuration are adding a new disk and attaching an existing disk, so option C is correct. Reformatting an existing disk is not an option, so options A, B, and D cannot be the correct answer.
119~ B~ 10 GB of data is small enough to store on a single disk. By creating an image of a disk with the data stored on it, you can specify that source image when creating a VM. Option A would require the data scientist to copy the data from Cloud Storage to a disk on the VM. Option C would similarly require copying the data. Option D would load data into a database, not a file system as specified in the requirements.
120~ B~ In the Network tab of the VM form, you can add another network interface, so option B is correct. GCP sets the IP address, so option A is incorrect. There is no option to specify a router or change firewall rules on the Network tab, so options C and D are incorrect.
121~ A~ The correct option is boot-disk-type, which is option A. The other three options are not parameters to the gcloud compute instances command.
122~ A~ Option A is the correct command. It is the only option that includes a correct machine type and properly specifies the name of the instance. Option B uses the --cpus parameter, which does not exist. Option C uses the parameter instance-name, which does not exist. The instance name is passed as an argument and does not need a parameter name. Option D is incorrect because machine type n1-4-cpu is not a valid machine type.
123~ C~ Option C is the correct command, which is gcloud compute instances, to indicate you are working with VMs, followed by the stop command and the name of the VM. Option A is incorrect because halt is not an option. Option B is incorrect because –terminate is not a parameter. Option D is missing the word instances, which indicates you are working with VMs.
124~ B~ SSH is service for connecting to a remote server and logging into a terminal window. Once logged in, you would have access to a command line, so option B is the right answer. FTP is a file transfer protocol and does not allow you to log in and perform system administration tasks. RDP is a protocol used to remotely access Windows servers, not Ubuntu, which is a Linux distribution. ipconfig is a command-line utility for configuring IP stacks on a device and does not allow you to log into a remote server.
125~ A~ All of the statements in option A are true and relevant to billing and costs. Option B is correct that VMs are billed in 1-second increments, but the only preemptible VMs are shut down within 24 hours of starting. Option C is incorrect because discounts are not limited to some regions. Option D is incorrect because VMs are not charged for a minimum of 1 hour.
126~ A B C~ The environment is already set up you dont need to do anything else.
127~ B~ gsutil cp my_file.txt gs://[bucket]
128~ D~ Deployment Manager
129~ C~ .profile
130~ A~ There are four ways you can interact with GCP: There’s the GCP Console, Cloud Shell and the Cloud SDK, the APIs, and the Cloud Mobile App. The Cloud Explorer is not a Google Cloud tool.
131~ B~ The GCP Console is a graphical user interface and Cloud Shell is a command-line tool. Both tools allow you to interact with GCP. Even though GCP Console can do things Cloud Shell can't do and vice-versa, don’t think of them as alternatives, but think of them as one extremely flexible and powerful interface.
132~ A~ The Compute Engine page is where you have the option of creating a single VM instance, so option A is the correct answer. App Engine is used for containers and running applications in language-specific runtime environments. Kubernetes Engine is used to create and manage Kubernetes clusters. Cloud Functions is where you would create a function to run in Google’s serverless cloud function environment.
133~ B~ Instances can be stopped, and when they are, then you cannot connect to them via SSH, which makes option B the correct answer. Starting the instance will enable SSH access. Option A is not correct because you can log into preemptible machines. Option C is incorrect because there is no No SSH option. Option D is incorrect because the SSH option can be disabled.
134~ B~ The Reset command can be used to restart a VM; thus, option B is correct. The properties of the VM will not change, but data in memory will be lost. There is no Reboot, Restart, Shutdown, or Startup option in the console.
135~ C~ Labels, members of a managed instance group, and status are all available for filtering, so option C is the correct answer. You can also filter by internal IP, external IP, zone, network, deletion protection, and member of a managed or unmanaged instance group.
136~ A~ To function properly, the operating system must have GPU libraries installed, so option A is correct. The operating system does not have to be Ubuntu based, and there is no need to have at least eight CPUs in an instance before you can attach and use a GPU. Available disk space does not determine if a GPU is used or not.
137~ A~ If you add a GPU to a VM, you must set the instance to terminate during maintenance, which makes option A the correct response. This is set in the Availability Policies section of the VM configuration form. The instance does not need to be preemptible and it can have non-boot disks attached. The instance is not required to run Ubuntu 14.02 or later.
138~ B~ When you first create a snapshot, GCP will make a full copy of the data on the persistent disk. The next time you create a snapshot from that disk, GCP will only copy the data that has changed since the last snapshot. Option A is incorrect; GCP does not store a full copy of the second snapshot. Option C is incorrect; the first snapshot is not deleted automatically. Option D is incorrect, subsequent snapshots do not incur 10 percent overhead.
139~ D~ To work with snapshots, a user must be assigned the Compute Storage Admin role, which makes option D the correct answer. The other options are fictitious roles.
140~ C~ Images can be created from four sources, namely, disks, snapshots, cloud storage files, or another image, so option C is the right answer. Database export files are not sources for images.
141~ B~ Deprecated marks the image as no longer supported and allows you to specify a replacement image to use going forward, making option B the correct answer. Deprecated images are available for use but may not be patched for security flaws or have other updates. The other options are fictitious features of images.
142~ C~ The base command for working with instances is gcloud compute instances,  which makes option C the correct answer. The list command is used to show details  of all instances. By default, output is in human-readable form, not json. Using the  --format json option forces the output to be in JSON format. --output is not a  valid option.
143~ B~ –-async causes information about the start process to be displayed; therefore, option B  is correct. --verbose is an analogous parameter in many Linux commands. --describe provides details about an instance but not necessarily the startup process. --details is not a valid parameter.
144~ C~ The command to delete an instance is gcloud compute instances delete followed by the name of the instance, so option C is correct. Option A is incorrect because there is no instance parameter. Option B is incorrect because that command stops but does not delete the instance. Option D is missing instances in the command, which is required to indicate what type of entity is being deleted.
145~ A~ gcloud compute instances is the base command followed by delete, the name of the instance, and --keep-disks=boot, so option A is correct. There is no --save-disk parameter. Option C is wrong because filesystem is not a valid value for the keep-disk parameter. Option D is missing the instances option which is required in the command.
146~ B~ The correct answer is option B, which is to use the describe command. Option A will show some fields but not all. Options C and D are incorrect because there is no detailed parameter.
147~ B~ Instance groups are sets of VMs that can be configured to scale and are used with load balancers, which contribute to improving availability, so option B is correct. Preemptible instances are not highly available because they can be shut down at any time by GCP. Cloud Storage is not a Compute Engine component. GPUs can help improve throughput for math-intensive operations but do not contribute to high availability.
148~ B~ An instance group template is used to specify how the instance group should be created, which makes option B the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because instances are created automatically when an instance group is created. Boot disk images and snapshots do not have to be created before creating an instance group.
149~ B~ The command to delete an instance group is gcloud compute instance-template delete, so option B is correct. Option A incorrectly includes the term instances. Option C is in incorrect order. Option D is wrong because instance-template is in the wrong position and is plural in the option.
150~ C~ You can configure an autoscaling policy to trigger adding or removing instances based on CPU utilization, monitoring metric, load balancing capacity, or queue-based workloads. Disk, network latency, and memory can trigger scaling if monitoring metrics on those resources are configured. So, option C is correct.
151~ B~ Unmanaged instance groups are available for limited use cases such as this. Unmanaged instance groups are not recommended in general. Managed instance groups are the recommended way to use instance groups, but the two different configurations prevents their use. Preemptible instances and GPUs are not relevant to this scenario.
152~C~ Kubernetes creates instance groups as part of the process of creating a cluster, which makes option C the correct answer. Stackdriver, not instance groups, is used to monitor the health of nodes and to create alerts and notifications. Kubernetes creates pods and deployments; they are not provided by instance groups.
153~A~ A Kubernetes cluster has a single cluster master and one or more nodes to execute workloads, so option A is the correct answer. Stackdriver is not part of the Kubernetes cluster; it is a separate GCP service. Kubernetes does not require instances with at least four vCPUs; in fact, the default node configuration uses one vCPU.
154~C~ Pods are single instances of a running process in a cluster, so option C is correct. Pods run containers but are not sets of containers. Application code runs in containers that are deployed in pods. Pods are not controllers, so they cannot manage communication with clients and Kubernetes services.
155~B~ Services are applications that provide API endpoints that allow applications to discover pods running a particular application, making option B correct. Options A and C, if they could be coded using the API designed for managing clusters, would require more code than working with services and are subject to changes in a larger set of API functions. Option D is not an actual option.
156~C~ ReplicaSets are controllers that are responsible for maintaining the correct number of pods, which makes option C the correct answer. Deployments are versions of application code running on a cluster. Stackdriver is a monitoring and logging service that monitors but does not control Kubernetes clusters. Jobs is an abstraction of workloads and is not tied to the number of pods running in a cluster.
157~B~ Multizone/multiregion clusters are available in Kubernetes Engine and are used to provide resiliency to an application, so option B is correct. Option A refers to instance groups that are a feature of Compute Engine, not directly of Kubernetes Engine. Option C is incorrect; regional deployments is a fictitious term. Load balancing distributes load and is part of Kubernetes by default. If load is not distributed across zones or regions, it does not help to add resiliency across data centers.
158~A~ Option A is the best answer. Starting with an existing template, filling in parameters, and generating the gcloud command is the most reliable way. Option D may work, but multiple parameters that are needed for your configuration may not be in the script you start with. There may be some trial and error with this option. Options B and C may lead to a solution but could take some time to complete.
159~A~ The correct command is option A. Option B has beta in the wrong position. Option C is missing beta. Option D is missing the --num-nodes parameter name.
160~C~ Time to Live is not an attribute of deployments, so option C is the correct answer. Application name, container image, and initial command can all be specified.
161~B~ Deployment configuration files created in Cloud Console are saved in YAML format. CSV, TSV, and JSON are not used.
162~C~ The kubectl command is used to control workloads on a Kubernetes cluster once it is created, so option C is correct. Options A and B are incorrect because gcloud is not used to manipulate Kubernetes processes. Option D is wrong because beta is not required in kubectl commands.
163~C~ Option C is the correct command. Option A uses the term upgrade instead of scale. Option B incorrectly uses gcloud. Option D uses the incorrect parameter pods.
164~D~ Stackdriver is a comprehensive monitoring, logging, alerting, and notification service that can be used to monitor Kubernetes clusters.
165~B~ Workspaces are logical structures for storing information about resources in a project that are being monitored, so option B is correct. Stackdriver works with logs, but a log is not required before starting to use Stackdriver. Pods and ReplicaSets are part of Kubernetes, not Stackdriver.
166~C~ The Stackdriver Instance Detail page includes time-series charts on CPU usage, network traffic, and disk I/O.
167~B~ When creating an alert policy, you can specify conditions, notifications, and documentation, making option B the correct answer. Options A and D are incorrect because there is no Time to Live attribute on policies. Option C is wrong because it does not include notifications and documentation.
168~A~ Alerts can have multiple channels, so Option A is correct. Channels include email, webhooks, and SMS text messaging as well as third-party tools such as PagerDuty, Campfire, and Slack. There is no need for multiple alerts with individual notifications. Option C is ad hoc and would require additional maintenance overhead. Option D does not meet requirements.
169~B~ Alerts are assigned to instances or sets of instances; therefore, option B is correct. Option A is incorrect because it does not include groups. Option C is incorrect because it does not include instances. Option D is wrong because alerts are not assigned to pods.
170~A~ All interactions with the cluster are done through the master using the Kubernetes API. If an action is to be taken on a node, the command is issued by the cluster master, so option A is the correct answer. Options B and D are incorrect because they are controllers within the cluster and do not impact how commands are received from client devices. Option C is incorrect because kubectl, not gcloud, is used to initiate deployments.
171~A~ Services provide a level of indirection to accessing pods. Pods are ephemeral. Clients connect to services, which can discover pods. ReplicaSets and StatefulSets provide managed pods. Alerts are for reporting on the state of resources.
172~B~When on the Cloud Console pages, you can click the cluster name to see a Details page, so option B is the correct answer. Typing the name of cluster in the search bar does not always return cluster details; it can return instance group details. There is no such command as gcloud cluster details.
173~D~You can find the number of vCPUs on the cluster listing in the Total Cores column or on the Details page in the Node Pool section in the size parameter, making option D correct. The Labels section does not have vCPU information.
174~B~The correct command includes gcloud container to describe the service, clusters to indicate the resource you are referring to, and list to indicate the command, which makes option B the correct answer. Options A and C are not valid commands.
175~B~It is likely you do not have access privileges to the cluster. The gdcloud container clusters get-credentials command is the correct command to configure kubectl to use GCP credentials for the cluster, so option B is the right option. Options A, C, and D are invalid commands.
176~C~Clicking the Edit button allows you to change, add, or remove labels, so option C is the correct answer. The Connect button is on the cluster listing page, and the Deploy button is for creating new deployments. There is no way to enter labels under the Labels section when displaying details.
177~D~When resizing, the gcloud container clusters resize command requires the name of the cluster and the node pool to modify. The size is required to specify how many nodes should be running. Therefore, option D is correct.
178~B~Pods are used to implement replicas of a deployment. It is a best practice to modify the deployments, which are configured with a specification of the number of replicas that should always run, so option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect; you should not modify pods directly. Options C and D are incorrect because they do not change the number of pods running an application.
179~C~Deployments are listed under Workloads, making option C the correct answer. The Cluster option shows details about clusters but does not have details on deployments. Storage shows information about persistent volumes and storage classes. Deployments is not an option.
180~B~There are four actions available for deployments (Autoscale, Expose, Rolling Update, and Scale), so option B is correct. Add, Modify, and Delete are not options.
181~C~Since deployments are managed by Kubernetes and not GCP, we need to use a kubectl command and not a gcloud command, which makes option C correct. Option D is incorrect because it follows the gcloud command structure, not the kubectl command structure. The kubectl command has the verb, like get, before the resource type, like deployments, for example.
182~D~You can specify container image, cluster name, and application name along with the labels, initial command, and namespace; therefore, option D is the correct answer.
183~A~The Deployment Details page includes services, so option A is the correct answer. Containers are used to implement services; service details are not available there. The Clusters Detail page does not contain information on services running in the cluster.
184~A~kubectl run is the command used to start a deployment. It takes a name for the deployment, an image, and a port specification. The other options are not valid kubectl commands.
185~A~Option A shows the correct command, which is kubectl delete service mlclassifier-3. Option B is missing the service term. Options C and D cannot be correct because services are managed by Kubernetes, not GCP.
186~C~The Container Registry is the service for managing images that can be used in other services, including Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine, making option C correct. Both Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine use images but do not manage them. There is no service called Container Engine.
187~A~Images are managed by GCP, so the correct command will be a gcloud command, so option A is the correct answer. Option B is incorrect because the verb is placed before the resource. Options C and D are incorrect because kubectl is for managing Kubernetes resources, not GCP resources like container images.
188~B~The correct command is gcloud container images describe, which makes option B the right answer. describe is the gcloud verb or operation for showing the details of an object. All other options are invalid commands.
189~B~The kubectl expose deployment command makes a service accessible, so option B is the correct answer. IP addresses are assigned to VMs, not services. The command gcloud does not manage Kubernetes services, so option C is incorrect. Option D is incorrect because making a service accessible is not a cluster-level task.
190~B~Autoscaling is the most cost-effective and least burdensome way to respond to changes in demand for a service, so option B is the correct answer. Option A may run nodes even when they are not needed. Option C is manually intensive and requires human intervention. Option D reduces human intervention but does not account for unexpected spikes or lulls in demand.
191~B~Cloud engineers working with Kubernetes will need to be familiar with working with clusters, nodes, pods, and container images. They will also need to be familiar with deployment. Option B is the correct answer because the other options are all missing an important component of Kubernetes that cloud engineers will have to manage.
